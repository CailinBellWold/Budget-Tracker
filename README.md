## Description 

Add functionality to an existing Budget Tracker application to allow for offline access and functionality.

### Motivation

Gaining skills to allow user of my apps to use offline functionality will allow users to access their information any time, improving overall app functionality.

<!-- ### Learning Targets -->
<!-- This exercise provided opportunities to test my budding skills with Mongo and Mongoose, and allowed further opportunities to develop pre-existing skills handling routes with Express.js -->

2. The app is built using a MongoDB database.
3. The app is deployed to Heroku.

## Technologies Used 
- Heroku
- JavaScript
- Mongo
- [MongoDB Atlas] (https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)
- Mongoose
- Node.js
- [NPM Express.js Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)
- [NPM Express-Session Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session)
- [NPM dotenv Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)
- [NPM nodemon Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon)

<!-- ## Local Installation & Usage -->
